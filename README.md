# Polly Audio Synthesizer Automation

This project automates the conversion of text to speech using **Amazon Polly** and uploads the audio to **Amazon S3**, triggered by GitHub Actions.

---

## üîß How It Works

- `synthesize.py` reads text from `speech.txt`
- Synthesizes it into `speech.mp3` using Polly
- Uploads to your S3 bucket under:
  - `polly-audio/beta.mp3` (on Pull Request)
  - `polly-audio/prod.mp3` (on merge to `main`)
